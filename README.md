<tt>The 'Surpass-Tool' is desgined to serve as a swiss army knife password testing framework. Easy to run, easy to customize and written in Python. Users can test their/clients passwords against a precompiled database containing passwords from notable breaches that have been leaked and disclosed. And its all done locally so as to not require a web server or outside connection.</tt>
