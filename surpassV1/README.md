## This is the first iteration of the Surpass-Tool
<hr>
<tt>V1 of the surpass-tool responds a little differently to the [main] passwd 
database being included before running the script for the first time.</tt>
<br>
<tt>if you attemp to run and receive an error, try remove the 'main.txt' file</tt>
<br>
<tt>remember this tool is in development and is a work in progress. 
you may have to trouble shoot a little if it gives you any issues.</tt>
<br>
<tt>if you have anything creative or unique to contribute feel free to send a message.</tt>
